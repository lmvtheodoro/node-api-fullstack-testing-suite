// Documentation: Limitations and Strengths of Cypress in Backend Testing (Gray Box & Black Box)

// Overview:
// Cypress is primarily designed for end-to-end (E2E) testing, focusing on automating user interactions 
// with web applications through the frontend. Although it supports API interception and response stubbing, 
// its scope is limited when it comes to backend or server-side testing. However, it excels in certain API testing 
// strategies, including black box testing.

// Limitations of Gray Box Testing with Cypress:
// Gray box testing involves having partial knowledge of the internal workings of an application 
// (e.g., API responses and some backend logic) while interacting with the system through the frontend.
// Cypress can simulate backend interactions by intercepting and stubbing API requests, but it cannot directly 
// test backend logic, databases, or microservices without involving the UI. 
//
// **Important Limitation:**
// Cypress can only mock or stub API responses if the request is initiated by the frontend (e.g., via an XHR or 
// Fetch request triggered by a button click, page load, etc.). It cannot mock or intercept API calls that are
// initiated purely from the backend, such as server-to-server communication or backend-only logic.

// Example: Stubbing a Response with a String
// The following example demonstrates how Cypress can intercept and mock an API call through the frontend:
it('Should Stub Google Api Response With a String (Gray Box)', () => {

  // Intercept a GET request to any URL matching the pattern **/users/** and stub a fake response
  cy.intercept('GET', '**/complete/**', {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Hello, world!'  // Mock response body
  }).as('getGoogleCompleteSearchResponse')  // Alias the request as 'getUsers'

  // Visit a mock frontend that interacts with an API (in this case, the ReqRes API)
  cy.visit('https://google.com/')

  // Wait for the intercepted request to be made
  cy.wait('@getGoogleCompleteSearchResponse')

  // Assert that the response body matches the mocked value
  cy.get('@getGoogleCompleteSearchResponse').then((interception) => {
    expect(interception.response.body).to.equal('Hello, world!');
  });
});

// Black Box API Testing with Cypress:
// While gray box testing has limitations, Cypress is highly effective for **black box API testing**.
// Black box testing focuses on testing the functionality of an API without needing to know its internal 
// code structure or logic and without interacting with it. On this scenario, Cypress can send real requests 
// to APIs, intercept/mock responses, and validate status codes, payloads, and more, making it a powerful tool 
// for end-to-end API testing.

// Example: Testing an API's Real Response (Black Box Testing)
it('Testing the API with a Real Response (Black Box)', () => {
  // Send a real GET request to a public API
  cy.request('GET', 'https://reqres.in/api/users/2')
    .then((response) => {
      // Assert that the response status is 200 (OK)
      expect(response.status).to.equal(200);

      // Assert the response body contains the expected data
      expect(response.body.data).to.have.property('id', 2);
    });
});


// Key Considerations:
// 1. **Cypress is a Frontend-Focused Tool**: It automates browser interactions and can mock API responses 
//    through the frontend, but it does not handle purely backend testing.
// 2. **Gray Box Testing**: Cypress supports gray box testing only through UI interactions, 
//    allowing for the interception and stubbing of API requests initiated by the frontend. 
//    It cannot directly interact with backend logic (such as databases or internal services) without going 
//    through the frontend layer. For backend-only testing or more complex server-side interactions, other tools 
//    are more appropriate.
// 3. **Mocking API Responses**: Cypress can only mock or stub API responses for requests initiated by the frontend.
//    It **cannot** mock backend-to-backend API calls or server-side logic not exposed through the UI.
// 4. **Black Box API Testing**: Cypress excels at testing APIs from a black box perspective, where the focus is 
//    on sending real requests to APIs and validating their responses without needing knowledge of the APIâ€™s 
//    internal workings.
